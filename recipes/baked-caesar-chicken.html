    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>“If you think you can’t cook, this baked Caesar chicken recipe will convince people otherwise,” according to recipe developer Juliana Hale. Featuring a creamy sauce and buttery crouton topping, this recipe is perfect for simple weeknights at home.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Caesar salad croutons, crushed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter, melted</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts (1 1/2 to 2 pounds total)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup creamy Caesar salad dressing</li>
            <li>1/3 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon all purpose flour</li>
            <li>chopped fresh parsley to taste for garnish</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (180 degrees C). Coat a 2-quart baking dish with nonstick spray.</li>
            <li>Combine crushed croutons, Parmesan cheese, and butter; toss to mix. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Place chicken breasts between 2 sheets of plastic wrap. Pound to an even thickness with a meat mallet.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with pepper and salt on both sides and place chicken into the prepared baking dish.</li>
            <li>Stir together salad dressing, sour cream, and flour in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Spoon salad dressing mixture over chicken and turn to coat.</li>
            <li>Top with crouton mixture.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until topping is browned and chicken is longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Garnish with parsley. </li>
